OpenIDENet

OpenIDENet is an open source project maintained by the ContinuousTests
team www.continuoustests.com. The purpose of this tool is to provide a basic set of
IDE type features around you favorite editor like type search, fast file browsing, project file 
management, code snippets and more.

At the moment this project is in it's early stages but should work on Linux, MacOSX and windows.
It currently supports type search, file search and basic project management.
To connect to the editors OpenIDENet uses EditorEngine, another open source project
maintained by the Mighty Moose team. For .Net Builds and tests AutoTest.Net or ContinuousTests
is used. These are also projects maintained by the Mighty Moose team.

For now there are only language support for C#. However it supports easily writing
language plugins for any language in any language.

More information on how to get started will come shortly. Stay tuned!
